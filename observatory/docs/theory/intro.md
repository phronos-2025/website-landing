# Theory: Core Framework

Welcome to the Theory section of the P.H.R.O.N.O.S. Observatory. This section contains the foundational theoretical frameworks that guide our research.

## What You'll Find Here

The Theory section is organized into four key documents:

1. **[Constitution](/docs/theory/constitution)** - The foundational principles and values that guide P.H.R.O.N.O.S.
2. **[Definitions](/docs/theory/definitions)** - Precise definitions of key terms and concepts
3. **[Core Framework](/docs/theory/framework)** - The complete theoretical model
4. **Research Roadmap** - Future directions and hypotheses (Coming Soon)

## Status: Living Documents

All theory documents are **living documents** maintained through open peer review. We update them as new evidence emerges and as the research community provides feedback.
